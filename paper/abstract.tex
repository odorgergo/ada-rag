Using Twitter data for a demographic or political analysis is known to be challenging. Such an analysis is especially challenging for Switzerland due to the language differences and the country's lateness to adopt Twitter. In this project overcome these challenges and provide tree main contributions. Firstly, we find that contrarily to our expectation, rural parts of Switzerland seam to be better represented on Twitter (in our dataset). Secondly, we reconstruct the R\"ostrigraben based only on Tweets. Finally, we provide an unsupervised method to detect political activity in a dataset with very low political content. We evaluate our results by using our method to detect political events in Switzerland.
