\section{Summary}
We have presented a visualisation and analysis of the geographical and linguistic distribution of Swiss tweets, recreating the R\"ostigraben, and we have also proposed a bootstrapping method to extract political tweets. Our plots of the political tweets show that our method can detect significant political events by detecting increased Twitter activity around them. Our method shows a significant improvement over a completely supervised method using known politician accounts.
