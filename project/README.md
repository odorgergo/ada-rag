# Title

# Abstract
A 150 word description of the project idea, goals, dataset used. What story you would like to tell and why? What's the motivation behind your project?



# Research questions
A list of research questions you would like to address during the project. 


- Does the density of the location of tweets correspond to population densities? Or is are the tweets significantly more concentrated in cities?
- Can we reconstruct the RÃ¶stigraben only based on the language of tweets?
- Are there any spikes in activity and do they correspond to particular events (e.g. referendums) 
- How involved are swiss people in politics on twitter? Which areas are most involved?


# Dataset

We primarily plan to work with the swiss tweets dataset. We also plan to collect data on swiss polulation densities and voting patterns (http://www.predikon.ch/en/about).

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2

- Milestone 1 (november 13): Access the data (also the population densities), detect the language of the tweets and try to get preliminary results to our first two questions.

- Milestone 2 (november 28): Preliminary results for all 4 questions, and further specifying questions 3 and 4. Delivering a polished notebook for the milestone.


# Questions for TA

- The description mentioned sentiment scores, but we couldn't see it in the data. Is it available somewhere?
